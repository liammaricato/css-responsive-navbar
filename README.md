# CSS Responsive Navigation Bar

:scroll: A simple retracting navigation bar that aligns on the left of the screen when it's big enough and at the bottom of the screen if it's below 600px wide.

:bulb: Based on a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/biOMz4puGt8) from [Fireship's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA)

### :pushpin: Features:
- Icon bar
  - The bar extends when hovered and displays text for each icon
  - Retracts back when 'unhovered' to display only the icons
- Animated Logo
  - The logo spins 180 degrees when the bar is hovered
- Animated Icons
  - The icons show color when hovered
- Responsive bar
  - When the screen is less then 600px wide, the Navbar sticks to the bottom of the page and stops displaying the text from the icons


### :pencil2: To-Do:
- Theme changer (using CSS variables and JS)
  - Cycles between three themes by pressing the "Themefy" button on the Navbar
  - Also changes the icon of the button depending on the selected theme
