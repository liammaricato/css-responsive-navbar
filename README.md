# CSS Responsive Navigation Bar

:scroll: A simple retracting navigation bar that aligns on the left of the screen when it's big enough and at the bottom of the screen if it's below 600px wide.

:bulb: Based on a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/biOMz4puGt8) from [Fireship's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA)

### :pushpin: Features:
- Icon bar.
  - The bar extends when hovered and displays text for each icon.
  - Retracts back when 'unhovered' to display only the icons.
- Animated Logo.
  - The logo spins 180 degrees when the bar is hovered.
- Animated Icons.
  - The icons show color when hovered.
- Responsive bar.
  - When the screen is less then 600px wide, the Navbar sticks to the bottom of the page and stops displaying the text from the icons.
- More Responsiveness added.
  - Now Nav Bar is Responsive from size 320px to 2560px.

### :pencil2: To-Do:
- Theme changer (using CSS variables and JS).
  - Cycles between three themes by pressing the "Themefy" button on the Navbar.
  - Also changes the icon of the button depending on the selected theme.
